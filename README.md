# Mahalaya App
<i>An innovative and automated way of listening to Mahalaya!</i>

Can't get up at 4 AM on the day of Mahalaya? No problem! You have come to the right place. This app will allow you to choose a date and time, and will automatically play Mahalaya at that particular time.

## Salient Features:
1. Very small size apk, only 2.56 MB.
1. No advertisements.
1. App can be moved to SD card.
1. Built-in dark theme, even for phones that do not support dark mode.
1. Uses Java 8 libraries for reducing code complexity.
1. The Mahalaya media file can be placed either in the external SD card or the internal storage.
1. Does not use Android `AlarmManager`, so the playback will start under any circumstances (unless, of course, your phone switches off).
1. The media player is not dependent on UI, so the playback should continue even if your phone hangs.
1. Can be used on any device with Android Lollipop and above.

## How to use?
1. [Download](https://github.com/WrichikBasu/Mahalaya-Android2/releases/download/v3.0.0/Mahalaya-Android-v3.0.0.apk) the latest apk file and install it. (During installation, you might see a warning from Google Play Protect. Please ignore that and do not send this app for scanning.)
1. Download the Mahalaya media files (see below). The files can be stored on SD card or internal storage.
1. Open the app and proceed as directed. When asked, choose the Mahalaya media file that will be played by the app.
1. Once the program is started, you can see the time left for the playback to start. <b>Do not forget to set a decent media volume.</b>
1. That's it. Now this app will play Mahalaya when the time comes.
