## Privacy policy: Mahalaya App

Welcome to the Mahalaya App for Android!

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

This app collects no personally identifiable information. 
App preferences that you set (themes, etc.) are all stored on your device only and not transferred anywhere.
These preferences are cleared and reset as soon as the app's data is cleared or it is uninstalled.

The path to the media file that you choose stays with the app only as long as the program is running.
Once the program ends and Android garbage-collects this app's objects, that path is lost.

If you have any concerns regarding privacy, please feel free to send me an email, and I will surely help you out.

Yours sincerely,
